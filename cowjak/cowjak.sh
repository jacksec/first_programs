#This is an interactive shell script that utlises the cowsay shell feature developed by Tony Monroe
#To install the dependancies, you will first have to change the permissions of the file to allow it to use
#sudo apt-get install on your machine. Once that is done, just run ./cowjak install to run the installation script.
#After that, enjoy the fun that cowjak brings to your terminal, enjoy :)
